# Ruler

## Development Process

### Testing

- Always follow TDD where possible - first adding or adjusting tests, verifying that they fail, then making the minimal changes to pass the tests.
- Everything in this repository should be covered by tests. That always includes:
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - End-to-end tests

### Code Formatting

- Always ensure that the code is formatted correctly by running prettier before committing changes.

### Branches and Pull Requests

- Unless specifically instructed otherwise, all changes should be made in a feature branch and submitted as a pull request for review.
- Pull requests should be descriptive and clearly explain the changes being made, including the rationale behind the change, the functional changes, the specific files and modules affected.
- Before declaring a pull request ready for review, you must ensure that all the CI tests pass. These include:
  - `npm ci`
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm test`
  - `npm run build`
- IMPORTANT: Before committing, always use Prettier to ensure that the code is formatted correctly.
- IMPORTANT: When committing yourself with `git commit`, always pass `--author="AI <ruler+ai@okigu.com>"` so that your commits can be easily identified.
